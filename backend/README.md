TikTok and Twitch API Server
This server connects to the TikTok and Twitch APIs in order to retrieve data and interact with the platforms. The server listens for messages on the specified Twitch channel and sends them to connected clients using WebSockets. The server also uses the TikTok API to push messages to a live broadcast on TikTok.

Installation
Install Node.js and NPM
Clone this repository
Install dependencies: npm install
Copy constants.example.js to constants.js and salaisuus.example.js to salaisuus.js, then add your TikTok and Twitch API keys
Start the server: npm start
Usage
The server listens for WebSocket connections on port 8000 and for HTTP requests on port 3000.

WebSockets
Connect to the server using a WebSocket client and listen for messages on the message event. The message event will be emitted with the following data:

Copy code
{
message: string, // The message text
username: string, // The username of the sender
platform: string, // The platform the message was sent from (Twitch or TikTok)
isBroadcast: boolean // Whether the message was sent from a live broadcast
}
HTTP
Send HTTP requests to the server to access the following endpoints:

GET /emotes
Retrieves a list of global emotes from the Twitch API.

Response
Copy code
{
emotes: [
{
id: string,
code: string,
startIndex: number,
endIndex: number
}
...
],
pagination: {
cursor: string
}
}

## Huikan notet

To add multiple clients to this code, you would first need to define a route in the Express server that accepts client connections. This route would be responsible for creating a new WebSocket connection and adding the client to a list of connected clients.

For example, you could define a route like this:

Copy code
app.post('/clients', (req, res) => {
const client = req.body; // Expects a JSON object with client information

// Create a new WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket(client.url);

// Add the client to the list of connected clients
CLIENTS.push({
id: client.id,
ws
});

res.send({ message: 'Client added successfully' });
});
To use this route, a client would need to send a POST request to the /clients endpoint with a JSON object containing the client's information, such as its ID and the URL of the WebSocket server to connect to.

Once the client is added to the list of connected clients, you can send messages to it using the WebSocket connection. For example:

Copy code
CLIENTS.forEach(client => {
if (client.id === targetClientId) {
client.ws.send(message);
}
});
This code iterates over the list of connected clients and sends a message to the client with the specified ID.

Keep in mind that this is just one way to add multiple clients to this code. There are many other ways to achieve the same result, and the approach you choose will depend on your specific requirements and design decisions.
